React Redux Implementation Plan

1. Identify the states to be managed using Redux:
    - State 1
    - State 2
    - State 3

2. Define the actions to be dealt with:
    - Action 1
    - Action 2
    - Action 3

3. Determine how to respond to the actions:
    - Response 1
    - Response 2
    - Response 3

4. Create a visual architectural diagram to aid implementation:
    - Use pen and paper or digital drawing software
    - Include components, state management, and action flow

5. Share the diagram with your tutor for review:
    - Take a photo if using pen and paper
    - Export as PDF or PNG if using digital software

Remember to consult the React Redux documentation for detailed guidance on implementation.
